# Baseline Telco Customer Churn

This repository contains a baseline analysis and predictive model for customer churn at a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify high-risk customers and understand the key factors driving churn using Python and Power BI.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for Telco companies, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project explores customer behavior, service usage, and demographic data to:  

- Understand churn patterns and trends.  
- Visualize distributions and relationships between features and churn.  
- Build a **baseline logistic regression model** to predict churn probabilities.  
- Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

## Data

The `Data/` folder contains the datasets used for analysis:

- `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` — Original Kaggle dataset: customer demographic information, service subscriptions, and churn labels (`Yes`/`No`).
- `churn_data_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned version of the original dataset used for modeling and visualizations.
- `churn_probabilities.csv` — Churn probabilities generated by the baseline logistic regression model for each customer.

---

## Notebooks

The `Notebooks/` folder contains:

- `Baseline_Telco_Customer_Churn.ipynb`:  
  - Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
  - Baseline logistic regression model for churn prediction  
  - Generation of churn probabilities for dashboard integration

## Power BI Dashboards

The `PowerBI/` folder contains an interactive dashboard with **two pages**:

1. **Telco Customer Churn Overview** – Visualizes overall churn patterns, distributions, and feature analysis.  
2. **Customer Risk Overview** – Highlights individual customer churn probabilities and risk levels for targeted retention strategies.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/malaksoliman73/Telco-Customer-Churn.git 
```
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
3. Load the dataset from the `Data/` folder.  
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce EDA, visualizations, and the logistic regression model.  
5. Open the Power BI file in the `PowerBI/` folder to explore interactive visualizations.
